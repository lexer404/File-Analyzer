# File-Analyzer
This python code will analyzer a file based on certain criteria or characteristics. I used method/functions to make it easier to reuse the code or make any necessary changes. The program let's you choose a file to analyze. It counts the total number of lines in the file, total number of characters, total number of words, most frequent word.
